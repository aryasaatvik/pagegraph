//
// The library entries are pure data + string rendering (the core) or adapters to
// Vite/React. Their `node:` imports stay external and they never reach Effect, so a
// consumer that only declares SEO on routes installs no runtime dependency.
//
// `cli` is the one entry that reaches Effect and the Bun platform adapter. It is
// built as a separate pass that **bundles** `effect` and `@effect/*`: a published
// binary that resolved Effect from the consumer's tree would couple to the
// consumer's Effect version. Bundling makes the binary
// self-contained. `vite` and `lighthouse` stay external — the CLI loads the app
// graph through Vite and spawns Lighthouse, both optional peers.
