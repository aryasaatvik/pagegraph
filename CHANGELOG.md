## pagegraph@0.10.1

### Accept angle-bracket placeholders in FAQ answers

`faq-not-visible` no longer reports a plain-text JSON-LD answer that contains
placeholders such as `samva-<id>._domainkey` when the page renders them escaped.
Answers with real HTML markup are still compared by their text.

## pagegraph@0.10.0

### Check rendered content and page freshness

`pagegraph check --site <url>` fetches every declared page from a running
server and checks its server-rendered HTML. Indexable pages need exactly one
H1, a self-referencing canonical, and robots meta that matches the declaration.
FAQ answers and offer prices in JSON-LD must also appear in the visible text.
Skipped heading levels, an H1 that shares no term with the title, and pages
under a configured `content.minWords` floor are reported as warnings.
`pagegraph audit` now reports the heading and structured-data findings for every
HTML page it audits.

Routes can declare `modifiedAt`, which becomes the sitemap's `<lastmod>` just as
content dates already do. Dates must now be ISO 8601 (`2026-09-29`, or a
date-time with an offset): `check` fails on any other form, and the sitemap
refuses to render one instead of guessing its day. Set
`freshness: { maxAgeDays }` to report stale pages in `check`, and run
`pagegraph stale` to list pages to refresh, oldest first.

## pagegraph@0.9.0

### Find better internal linking opportunities

PageGraph now finds sitemap pages that links alone miss and suggests useful
contextual links backed by exact page text. Use `links candidates --site` to
review ranked suggestions, then pass them to `improve links --suggestions` to
approve edits.

## pagegraph@0.8.4

### Preserve workflow evidence and diagnose interrupted research

Selected pages retain their surrounding link relationships, and Executor evidence requires actual
completed provider invocations. Research instructions inspect current tool schemas and respect the
requested scope. OpenCode completions support configurable deadlines, bounded interruption, and
activity diagnostics. Validated research is saved before decision inference so downstream failures
retain useful evidence. Git mutation checks handle nested project roots and changed submodules.

## pagegraph@0.8.3

### Attribute Executor evidence from structured search results

PageGraph now recognizes tool identifiers returned in Executor search-result `path` fields, including
JSON-encoded output, so valid provider calls satisfy the workflow evidence gate. Discovery stays
limited to those structured fields, preventing unrelated dotted metadata from authorizing a call.

## pagegraph@0.8.2

### Recover incomplete workflow results

When an OpenCode turn collects Executor evidence but omits its final workflow JSON, PageGraph now
runs one tool-free repair turn within the original deadline. Repair restores the session's prior
permissions, and deadline failures report the configured timeout instead of an opaque transport
error.

## pagegraph@0.8.1

### Wait for Executor activation

Workflow commands now wait for the configured Executor plugin to appear in OpenCode's plugin
registry before starting a run. Registry failures still propagate immediately, and a bounded timeout
keeps missing or misconfigured Executor installations fail-closed.

## pagegraph@0.8.0

### Run page-backed SEO workflows

Combine PageGraph's deterministic route graph with an embedded OpenCode agent, project-owned
configuration, live Executor tools, and Jev decisions. The new workflow-oriented CLI covers keyword,
competitor, and authority research; SERP, content, and AI-search analysis; architecture planning; and
content, metadata, schema, and internal-link improvements.

- `pagegraph init` scaffolds a customizable `.pagegraph/opencode` preset with one SEO agent,
  workflow-specific skills, and editable Executor starter recipes.
- `research`, `analyze`, and `plan` workflows collect evidence without changing project files.
- `improve` workflows require a clean Git tree, support `--dry-run`, leave edits uncommitted, and
  record the resulting file changes.
- Every run persists its graph, project context, OpenCode session, live-tool evidence, Jev answers,
  Git provenance, and model provenance under `.pagegraph/runs`.

This release replaces the low-level public decision commands and input-oriented exports with the
smaller workflow surface. OpenCode owns model authentication and configuration; an Executor plugin
provides live SEO integrations discovered at runtime.

## pagegraph@0.7.0

### Answer SEO decisions with Jev

Add a reusable decision runner and five typed decision families, answered in one
TypeSafe System One call per input. Confident answers produce a plan; answers
inside the confidence band go to a review queue. Nothing is applied automatically.

- `pagegraph decide serp` — classify the SERP format and score our page's fit,
  intent, and title (aligned | mismatch | review).
- `pagegraph decide content` — score the content rubric and place page value on
  thin | adequate | strong (pass | flag | review).
- `pagegraph decide fit` — choose the best existing page for a query, or flag
  cannibalization or a gap (map | cannibalized | gap | review).
- `pagegraph decide meta` — rank supplied title/description candidates
  (choose:<id> | review).
- `pagegraph decide authority` — judge a link target's legitimacy, spam, and
  outreach worth, plus its fit (accept | spam | review).
- `pagegraph decide links` (and the retained `links decide`) — real reason,
  anchor present, direction (A→B / B→A / both), and relevance, with top-K
  per-source budget selection.

Shared flags: `--model`, `--threshold`, `--concurrency`, `--cache`, `--review-out`,
and `--budget` for links. Every record carries the model id and an input hash.

## pagegraph@0.6.1

### Assert contextual coverage on the rendered graph

`pagegraph links verify` now closes the loop between declared and served links:

- `links verify <url> --emit-rendered <path>` writes the crawl's raw edge set as a
  versioned `links-rendered` artifact that preserves each anchor's `region`
  (`body` vs `nav`/`footer`/`header`) and the provenance a gate needs — `origin`,
  `seed`, the rendered page paths, and the crawl's `limit`, `truncated`,
  `bodyTruncated`, and `failures`. It is also a drop-in input for
  `links candidates --rendered`.
- `links verify --rendered <path>` replays a saved artifact instead of crawling, so
  one crawl can be asserted repeatedly without re-fetching.
- `links verify --assert-coverage` evaluates the `seo.config.ts` `coverage` rules
  against the anchors a crawler actually receives. Only same-origin body-region
  anchors count, matching `check`'s `related`-only semantics; the rule universe
  stays the declared graph's sitemap-eligible pages. An unmet rule exits 1, and the
  command refuses to assert — rather than reporting a false pass — on a truncated
  crawl, a page that failed to fetch, a truncated body, a missing `coverage`
  policy, or an origin mismatch.

The default `--json` summary is unchanged; the `coverage` block appears only under
`--assert-coverage`.

## pagegraph@0.6.0

### Verify and plan contextual links

Add `pagegraph links`, three commands over the link graph:

- `links verify <url>` crawls served HTML and reports homepage depth, rendered
  orphans, and the declared-vs-rendered gap. Anchor extraction honors `<base href>`,
  and the crawl dedupes redirect targets and surfaces truncated bodies.
- `links candidates` proposes reviewable, section-clustered contextual links from
  the declared graph, excluding anchors already rendered, with an optional
  `--decide` pass.
- `links decide` answers real-reason and anchor-present probabilities for a
  candidate set through TypeSafe System One (Jev), routing below-threshold
  answers to human review.

`pagegraph check` also gains `--require-inbound` (with a configurable policy) so a
sitemap-eligible page must have at least N incoming contextual edges.

## pagegraph@0.5.1

### Bundle Effect into the CLI

The published `pagegraph` binary now bundles `effect` and `@effect/platform-bun`. It no longer asks
consumers to install optional Effect peers, and no longer breaks when the consumer resolves a
different Effect RC — the `effect/unstable/cli` constructors rename between RCs (`Flag.boolean` →
`Flag.Boolean` at rc.113). The library entries remain Effect-free.

## pagegraph@0.5.0

### Compare timestamped SEO audits

Add `pagegraph diff <before.json> <after.json>` with deterministic human and JSON
output, schema validation, and regression-aware exit behavior. Structural
findings, scanner failures, and lost coverage fail the command, while editorial
changes and volatile scanner evidence remain non-blocking.

## pagegraph@0.4.1

### Default optional CLI switches

Treat omitted boolean switches as `false` so `pagegraph audit` and the shared `--json` option work without requiring unrelated flags.

## pagegraph@0.4.0

### Audit any website from the CLI

Add a framework-independent `pagegraph audit` command and public audit toolkit with composable Effect scanners, pure SEO rules, hardened network validation, Lighthouse evidence, and versioned human or JSON reports.

## pagegraph@0.3.0

### Compose any schema.org entity

Add custom site and page JSON-LD with typed helpers, stable entity references, graph composition,
and an optional transform for extending, replacing, suppressing, or expanding generated schemas.
Existing JSON-LD generators continue to work unchanged.

## pagegraph@0.2.1

### Add organization legal identity fields

Organization JSON-LD can now include a legal name and structured postal address, making business identity details easier for search engines and agents to understand.

## pagegraph@0.2.0

### Add Content-Signal to robots.txt

`renderRobots` now takes `contentSignal` (the preference list), extra `directives`, and a `transform` for a last-mile override. The same fields live on `seo.config.ts` so `pagegraph robots` prints the same file as the route. Preview hosts still omit the origin-wide group lines. No default signal.

## pagegraph@0.1.0

### Initial release

Route-declared SEO for TanStack Router: declare once on the route, then derive
the sitemap, robots.txt, breadcrumbs, JSON-LD, cross-link graph, Vite coverage
gate, and CLI from that graph.
