/**
 * The SEO check engine: a set of rules run against the derived {@link SeoGraph}.
 * Pure — no I/O, no `clientEnv`, no React. The CLI's `pagegraph check` command and the
 * vitest suite both call {@link checkGraph}; nothing else derives correctness.
 *
 * Two severities, mapped to the CLI's exit contract:
 *  - `structural` — a declaration is internally broken (a link points nowhere, a
 *    card would render empty, a page contradicts its own robots/sitemap intent).
 *    Any structural violation fails `pagegraph check` (exit 1); these must not ship.
 *  - `editorial` — a quality smell (duplicate or mis-sized titles/descriptions).
 *    Reported as warnings; `pagegraph check` still exits 0 when only these are present.
 *
 * The graph only knows what declarations and frontmatter carry, so the rules are
 * scoped to that: per-node title/description live only on collection *instances*,
 * never on structural route nodes (whose head tags are composed at render time and
 * are not in the graph). Rules are data-driven and listed once in
 * {@link CHECK_RULES}.
